# PHP AutoIncluder
PHP setup to automatically include classes, as long as the file name of the file containing a class is the same as the class name (so ```BaseClass.php``` should contain the class ```BaseClass```).

Add the directory where this respository resides to ```include_path``` in ```php.ini```. Then, the AutoIncluder is available for inclusing without a directory specification.
